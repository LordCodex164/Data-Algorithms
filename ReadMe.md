# Sorting Algorithms

# Bubble Sort

# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Stable: Yes
# In-place: Yes
# Adaptive: No
# Best Case: O(n) - when the list is already sorted
# Worst Case: O(n^2) - when the list is sorted in reverse order
# Average Case: O(n^2) - when the list is in random order
# Recursive: No
# Iterative: Yes
# Comparison: Bubble sort is not a good sorting algorithm for large lists, as it is inefficient compared to other algorithms like quicksort or mergesort. However, it is simple to understand and implement, making it a good choice for small lists or for educational purposes.

# bubble is a sorting algoritm method that looks for the largest item in a list and it takes it to the end of the list. It does this by comparing each item in the list with the next item and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
